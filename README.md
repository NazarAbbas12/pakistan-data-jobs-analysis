Pakistan Data Jobs Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist job postings in Pakistan. The project explores the job market through companies, locations, platforms, and in-demand skills, along with trends over time.

📌 Project Overview

The data job market is rapidly growing in Pakistan. This project aims to uncover insights about hiring demand, platforms, locations, and the top technical skills required for data roles.

Objectives:

Identify which companies are hiring the most.

Analyze job postings by location and platform.

Understand skills demand for Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists.

Explore how skill demand trends change over time.

🔎 Analysis & Insights
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Top Hiring Companies: Identified the companies with the highest number of job listings.

Job Locations: Analyzed the distribution of jobs across different cities in Pakistan.

Job Platforms: Compared platforms (LinkedIn, Rozee, Indeed, etc.) for job postings.

2. Skills Demand

Data Analyst: Strong demand for SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

Data Engineer: High demand for Python, SQL, Spark, and AWS.

Data Scientist: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Python dominate.

3. Skills Trends

Visualized month-by-month demand for top skills (e.g., SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI).

Observed stable demand for SQL/Excel, with growth in Power BI and Python.

📊 Visuals

Some of the key visualizations include:

Bar charts of top hiring companies.

Job counts by city (location).

Platforms with most job postings.

Top skills for each role (Analyst, Engineer, Scientist).

Line plots of trending skills over time.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Data Cleaning + Visualization

✅ Conclusion

Karachi and Lahore dominate job postings for data roles in Pakistan.

LinkedIn is the leading platform for Data Analyst jobs.

SQL and Python are essential across all roles, but role-specific skills vary.

Power BI (for Analysts) and Cloud/Big Data tools (for Engineers) show strong demand growth.
